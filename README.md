# ChooseYourOwnAdventure
A text based RPG made in c++(work in progress)

06/24/2022 - I started this last semester when I was learning c++ I plan to implement attack, defense, speed, and health stats.
Stats of your character will be affected by the weapons and armor you are equipped with.
I also plan on designing a "talk it out" option in the battle system that will open multi choice dialogue with whatever you are fighting.
Depending on the dialogue chosen, different results can be achieved in and out of battle.
I may convert this project to java 
I plan to implement a save state system.
